Matlab Files from Class on Oct. 22

These files study the differences in accuracy in solving the compressed vs. uncompressed 
system arising from the exterior Laplace problem. 

Main File: 
Compare_Orig_Comp.m : Studies the accuracy of the compression algorithm outlined in Cheng et. al. 

Additional Files:
ID_Decomp_Cheng_etal_AugSystem.m: -compresses the augmented system from the exterior Laplace problem
                                  -plots resulting compressed matrix.

The remaining files are functions used in both scripts: 
GetAugSystem.m
GetSolution_OrigSystem.m
GetSolution_CompSystem.m
MakeEllipse.m
GetOffDiagBlock.m
id_decomp.m
